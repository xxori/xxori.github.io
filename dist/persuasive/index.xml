      <description>Hi all,
Usually, it wouldnâ€™t be a reach to call me a supporter of internet platforms like Reddit, Twitter, or even TikTok. They make it easy to gather a small group of like-minded people, and I myself have made some lifelong friends through these apps, so I hope you can see how this topic is near and dear to my heart. This is something I felt like I needed to write about to spread the sentiment.</description>
