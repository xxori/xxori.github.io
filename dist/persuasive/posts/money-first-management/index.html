They make it easy to gather a small group of like-minded people, and I myself have made some lifelong friends through these apps, so I hope you can see how this topic is near and dear to my heart. This is something I felt like I needed to write about to spread the sentiment.\nThe topic of this post is what I’ve taken to calling ‘money-first management,’ or the prioritisation by companies of short-term profit over other important factors, such as user satisfaction and privacy. Be it profit pushes, upcoming IPOS, or prospective corporate buyouts, executives are quick to act when they see green, redeeming user support and goodwill for a quick dollar and their retirement homes, ruining years of development and community. In an era where the internet has become integral to our daily lives, it’s easy to forget the humble beginnings of the web - a space born out of curiosity, innovation, and the noble pursuit of connecting people and sharing knowledge. However, as we fast-forward to the present, it’s becoming increasingly evident that the once perhaps pure intentions of the powers behind the internet are being overshadowed by corporate greed and money-first management. The internet has birthed companies that are worth more than most countries, and everyone seems to want to jump on the bandwagon. But it’s extremely crucial that we slow down for a moment to consider our priorities; the ones who make the internet such a valuable platform are us, the consumers, not the trillion-dollar corporations. Shouldn’t we have some say in what goes on?\nSome readers might have a sort of familiarity with the above concepts. Other tech critics have taken to calling it ‘enshittification’, a rather crude but potent neologism used satirically to represent the decline in products after they have already monopolised their target market. Thinking from a business perspective, it’s easy to see how it happens. Companies draw in an impressionable audience with free or loss-leading products such as Google’s search engine or Amazon’s fast shipping. After capturing the attention and usage of this audience, the company proceeds to ‘enshittify’ the product by, say, switching to a subscription model, or increasing prices arbitrarily, taking the profit for themselves. After all, even though Google has gotten slightly worse, nothing else is nearly as good right? This is the societal complacency which lets companies get away with this and even prompts other companies to push for it. Sometimes companies mistime this, like Twitter replacing the trustworthiness of the blue checkmark with a paid subscription, but most of the time they get away with it with only a brief outrage followed by nothingness. The problem is, despite how vocal the minority who can see the abuse is, the majority is generally silent. Even if a company loses 5% of their users after a change, if their profits per user rise by 15% this is generally justified. Do you want to be part of that silent mass? I think we should strive to show these companies what the internet means to us, to show them that we can’t tolerate this abuse forever.\nAnother phrase internet-goers might come across is ‘late-stage capitalism’, or something similar to it. While the phrase may have a somewhat dubious connotation due to the type of people who use it, there’s definitely something we should consider. Late-stage capitalism refers to a global, post-industrial economy where everything, even people, are made into commodities to be exploited for profit. What I’ve been discussing can be seen as a direct consequence of this in a way. Amidst intense pressure for infinite growth, companies are left to commodify user privacy, attention, and support. Instead of building closely-knit and trusting communities, companies only see us in the statistical form; they build user support through free services and promotions, and cash it in later through price hikes or aggressive advertising. This is the type of de-humanisation that frustrates me so much. Isn’t it the government and economy’s job to serve consumers, or has capitalism itself come too far in pushing for growth? Either way, individuals or even large groups are powerless to stop the ever-growing wave of multinational conglomerates pushing for profit and growth. While companies say they have their consumers’ wishes at heart, really, we are only numbers on some analytics spreadsheet to them.\nThe worst part of all this is that companies are increasingly incentivised to act like this, and they get away with it with little to no repercussions. Despite being so hostile to their users at times when it benefits them, companies like these are seen abundantly in the world’s largest companies, from Apple drawing in and locking in people to their own platforms, to Google extending, embracing, and extinguishing their competition. These never-before-seen corporate profits are effectively raising a flag to companies all over the world saying “everyone quick, exploit your users and you can become the next big thing; the next Apple.” Similar to the laws of inertia in the physics world, large bodies of people take a significant force to get moving, and thus even the most hostile platform changes usually lead to only mild outcry, followed by silence and implicit acceptance. Despite the vocal few crying out with their Google Graveyards and Microsoft Sins Lists, most people are simply too indifferent to generate the outrage and retaliation necessary to stop this behaviour. This is the thing that gets to me the most; the very people who built the golden age of the web are now quietly and implicitly supporting this abuse.\nThis is the overall goal of this article - to spread awareness and hopefully make you reconsider things. Even if it doesn’t mean much individually, I urge you to stop using the products of these companies and spread the message. Together, we can make a difference. Together, we can bring back the internet that we loved.\nThanks, P\n","wordCount":"1002","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"309289T"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://xxori.github.io/persuasive/posts/money-first-management/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TechTalk","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://xxori.github.io/persuasive/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://xxori.github.io/persuasive accesskey=h title="TechTalk (Alt + H)"><svg fill="currentcolor" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" enable-background="new 0 0 1000 1000"><g><g transform="translate(0.000000,512.000000) scale(0.100000,-0.100000)"><path d="M6470.3 4979.3c-61.3-32.6-701.4-651.6-1954.8-1891.5l-335.4-333.5L3381 3536.2c-440.8 429.3-835.6 801.1-879.7 826-253 136.1-592.2-86.2-590.3-389 1.9-130.3 61.3-201.2 668.8-795.3l597.9-584.5-868.2-11.5c-818.3-9.6-875.8-11.5-1006.1-51.7-299-90.1-528.9-226.1-728.3-429.3-220.4-222.3-343-433.1-431.2-735.9L1e2 1213.4v-2309.3-2309.3l44.1-149.5C238-3878.6 370.2-4097 613.6-4327c235.7-224.2 494.5-356.5 818.3-417.8 139.9-26.8 550-30.7 3572.3-30.7 3259.9.0 3420.9 1.9 3587.6 36.4 339.2 70.9 609.4 220.4 854.7 477.2 235.7 247.2 387.1 550 437 875.8 13.4 92 19.2 843.2 15.3 2376.4l-5.7 2242.2-44.1 143.7c-176.3 576.9-576.9 975.5-1159.5 1153.7-136.1 42.2-153.3 42.2-1824.5 53.7l-1688.4 9.6 904.6 887.3c557.7 546.2 918 914.2 939.1 958.2 95.8 201.2-15.3 458-239.6 551.9C6692.6 5027.2 6552.7 5023.3 6470.3 4979.3zm912.2-3294.4c172.5-84.3 310.5-222.3 394.8-394.8l65.2-134.2v-2251.8-2251.8l-65.2-132.2c-82.4-166.7-230-314.3-396.7-396.7l-132.2-65.2H4383.3 1518.2l-134.2 65.2c-172.5 84.3-310.5 222.3-394.8 394.8L924-3347.6v2251.8V1156l61.3 124.6c109.2 220.4 270.2 368 492.5 444.6 92 30.7 266.4 32.6 2934.1 28.8l2836.4-3.8L7382.5 1684.9zm1653.9-358.4c145.7-59.4 251.1-212.7 253-362.2.0-251.1-162.9-417.8-412.1-417.8-220.4.0-364.1 122.7-400.5 343C8425.1 1196.2 8747 1447.2 9036.4 1326.5zM9118.8-147.2c113.1-80.5 161-180.2 161-335.4s-47.9-254.9-161-335.4c-109.2-76.7-300.9-92-417.8-32.6-182.1 93.9-266.4 287.5-210.8 484.9 34.5 113.1 118.8 216.6 214.6 260.7 36.4 15.3 109.2 23 195.5 19.2C9017.3-89.7 9049.8-99.3 9118.8-147.2z"/></g></g></svg>TechTalk</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://xxori.github.io/persuasive/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://xxori.github.io/persuasive/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://xxori.github.io/persuasive/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://xxori.github.io/persuasive>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://xxori.github.io/persuasive/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Money-First Management is Ruining the Internet</h1><div class=post-meta>5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;309289T</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Hi all,</p><p>Usually, it wouldn’t be a reach to call me a supporter of internet platforms like Reddit, Twitter, or even TikTok.
